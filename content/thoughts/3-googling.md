Yeah, it's gonna be all about googling!

because I'm still getting some questions like; what is xyz?

What the fuck bro, go to google and ask yourself, which is what I'm doing.

Almost 2024 here, and people still lazy to googling ðŸ¥²

Googling is important skill:
1. when google yourself before asking, you're respecting others time
2. and you're improving yourself on the "learning on your own"

I'm always googling when I see idiom, abbreviation, or something I don't know -> I'm immediately googling otherwise I forget ðŸ˜…
