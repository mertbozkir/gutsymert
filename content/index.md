Yo yo yo guys, Mert is here! 

**A Techno optimist gutsy person!**

Yeah, I'm introducing myself that way, after reading [The Techno-Optimist Manifesto](https://a16z.com/) I became more and more optimistic about technology and at the same time learnt a lot about e/acc. 


**What I'm gonna do here?**

As usually, I'm expressing myself publicly to learn more about myself, and getting better and better of expressing myself to others! 

I talk to myself often, and I want to record my thoughts to remember what I was thinking and how I've grown.



**All posts will be under [/thoughts folder](/thoughts/)**

```poetry
Stay gutsy and reach out to me if you need anything!
Mert :)
